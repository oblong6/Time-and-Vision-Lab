# Contributing

## What goes where

- Meeting materials belong under `meetings/YYYY/YYYY-MM-DD_Day_HHMM/`
- Slides go in `slides/`
- Notes and minutes go in `notes/`
- Supporting materials go in `files/`
- Important notices should be linked from the relevant meeting folder and added to `announcements/`

## File naming

Use: `YYYY-MM-DD_topic_presenter.ext`

## Suggested workflow

- Create a branch for non-trivial changes (optional for small edits)
- Open a pull request for review if the change affects structure or shared materials
- Keep meeting folders self-contained (README plus links to files in that folder)

## Sensitive or unpublished content

Assume meeting materials are internal unless explicitly agreed otherwise by the presenter or a supervisor.
