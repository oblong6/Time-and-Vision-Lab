# Social events committee


![Social Events Committee banner](https://liamjordan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/SEC.png)

The Time and Vision Lab Group social events committee exists to organise informal, optional social meet-ups outside of work. The aim is simple: help people across the Bruno and Souto labs get to know each other, keep the group feeling cohesive, and make lab life more enjoyable.

## Chairs

The committee is chaired by:
- Nick S. Trajcevski
- Helena Tatay Marco

Thank you to Nick and Helena for volunteering to coordinate this.

## What has been discussed so far

The group has agreed in principle that:
- social events should be informal and low-pressure
- attendance is always optional
- frequency should be decided by the group rather than fixed in advance
- events should be accessible and reasonably priced where possible

This committee will handle coordination (ideas, dates, logistics) and keep communication simple and visible to everyone.

## How events will be stored in this repository

Each social event will have its own folder in this directory. That folder will act as the single place for all relevant information, for example:
- the event summary and plan (`README.md`)
- date, time, venue, and joining instructions
- any polls, sign-ups, or decision notes that led to the event
- any links, menus, accessibility notes, or travel details if relevant
- photos from the event if taken and if people are happy for them to be stored here

If photos are included, only add photos where everyone in the image is comfortable with it and it is appropriate for an internal lab repository.

## Templates

Use the templates:
- `./EVENT.md/` for creating a new event folder
- `./POLL.md/` for running a poll (Google Forms link)
- `./SUGGESTION.md/` for capturing a suggestion before turning it into a poll or event

## What happens next

- Polls will be circulated to decide preferred formats, venues, and timing.
- Once preferences are clear, the committee will propose one or more initial events.
- Confirmed plans, details, and any joining instructions will be linked here and, where helpful, pinned in the repository.

## Where to find updates

- Polls and updates will be added to this folder (or linked from here).
- Confirmed events will be listed below as they are scheduled, with links to the relevant event folder.
